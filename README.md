Repository for CS210 projects under the 22EW1 term at SNHU. 
Code by Erika Salkeld

The project I have decided to upload would be the assignment from Project One. Chada Tech has asked the team to create a program where clients can view a 12-hour and 24-hour clock on the customers website.

I feel I did really well in keeping the code simple and readable. The functions were clearly defined and followed a logical flow.

I feel my code could have included more notes to clarify what the code was covering for readers to understand. By doing so, it is a great reminder for myself, and is a great notice to other programmers who may be working on the code. 

The most challenging part part of the code would probably be following a logical flow similar to the flow chart initially, as this was a much larger code than I has previously wrote. To overcome this, I made sure I worked on the code piece by piece in order to ensure each individual variable and function worked properly. 

The skills of understanding the purpose of OOP programs will transfer to any OOP based language. I made this program readable and maintainable by making notes within the code and by working on the code piece by piece.
